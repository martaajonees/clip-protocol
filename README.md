## Project Description
Learning analytics involves collecting and analyzing data about learners to improve educational outcomes. However, this process raises concerns about the privacy of individual data. To address these concerns, this project implements differential privacy algorithms, which add controlled noise to data, ensuring individual privacy while maintaining the overall utility of the dataset. This approach aligns with recent advancements in safeguarding data privacy in learning analytics. 

In this project, we explore two local differential privacy (LDP) algorithms designed for sketching with privacy considerations:

* **Single-User Dataset Algorithm**: This algorithm is tailored for scenarios where data is collected from individual users. Each user's data is perturbed locally before aggregation, ensuring that their privacy is preserved without relying on a trusted central authority. Techniques such as randomized response and local perturbation are employed to achieve this. 

* **Multi-User Dataset Algorithm**: In situations involving data from multiple users, this algorithm aggregates the perturbed data to compute global statistics while preserving individual privacy. Methods like private sketching and frequency estimation are utilized to handle the complexities arising from multi-user data aggregation

## Online Execution
You can execute the code online using Google Colab. Google Colab sessions are intended for individual users and have limitations such as session timeouts after periods of inactivity and maximum session durations. 

- For **single-user dataset** scenarios, click the link below to execute the method: [Execute in Google Colab (Single-User)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dY1OSfRECHFBFYaX_5ToZy-KynjT_0z0?usp=sharing)

- For **multi-user dataset** scenarios, click the link below to execute the method: [Execute in Google Colab (Multi-User)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zenZ2uTNYVNylNJ7ztIj5x_cIQVXP4HV?usp=sharing)
